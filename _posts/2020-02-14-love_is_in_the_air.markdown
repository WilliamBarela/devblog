Today is special for because it marks the first day that I will again be posting blogs.
I finally got a chance to get around to setting up my own blog again after a long haitus.

I've still got a lot of work to do to modify the minimal theme and add css, js and font customizations, but it's a starting point for when you don't want to start completely from scratch building a blog.
I have other projects which I have to put more time into, so maybe someday I'll start from scratch with Jekyll and build my own custom theme like the awesome Mike Rose from [MadeMistakes](https://mademistakes.com/ "MadeMistakes"). Nevertheless, for now this will do since this blog is about spreading knowledge and jotting down my reflections and solutions to difficult or maybe just obscure software development solutions that I run across as I code my life away (_wink wink_).
I hope you can join me and bare with the dust while I get this site looking right. There is some good content and tutorials to come.
