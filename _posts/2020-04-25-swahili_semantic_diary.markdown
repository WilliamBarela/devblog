Swahili Semantic Diary is an application which is intended to help learners of Kiswahili to improve their vocabulary. Vocabulary building is one of the most dificult aspects of language learning, expecially in a target language where most lexemes have no shared roots with the learner's mother tongue. Swahili is a language with a very regular morphology with few exceptions as it is an agglutinative language. Despite that regularity, it is also challenging to a learner whose L1 language is not Bantu based since it has a much higher number of classes of declensions for nouns which impact both verb conjugation and adjective declinsion. This app helps acts as a person journal/diary for the language learner while allowing for a vocabulary gloss with grammatical information to ensure that new words are effectively learned. Furthermore, there are few applications which assist L2 Swahili learners. With this application, I hope to reduce this void.
