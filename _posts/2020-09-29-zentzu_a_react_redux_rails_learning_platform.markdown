Zentzu is an application that seeks to help give online learners and teachers where "meaning" can be found. In specific, it takes the approach to learning that knowledge is a shared construct. We all have knowledge, we all can contribute. We all also have many shared questions which others have the answers to and ones which we have the answer to.
I built Zentzu (the Basque word for "meaning", or "sense") to attempt to broaden our collective knowledge and reduce the load on educators who oftentimes receive a multitude of similar, if not identical questions from learners by email. Additionally, we all can be educators if we are presented an open forum where many can contribute and a multitude can voice their agreementment or lack thereof.
How Zentzu accomplishes this is by creating a platform where classes can be modeled online, allowing students to follow a class, pose questions, post answers, and rate others' answers. Answers are lifted by rank and the lead of the class (i.e., the instructor) may override any answer to lift it above all others.
This framework allows for students to be able to quickly find the most accurate answer based on the collective knowledge of the class while deferring to the instuctor's knowledge as the definitive answer to any question.

Although the principal use case would be for educators to create a class and students to subscribe to that class forum, others are also able to create a class where they can share their knowledge about a stubject.

Zentzu is built with a Rails API as the backend and a React and Redux frontend. I also hope to soon write a React-Native client which can feed off that API and be published on the stores of mobile platforms.
