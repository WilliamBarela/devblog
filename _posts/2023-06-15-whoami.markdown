Big bang...I am.

Fractal...I am

Expansive...I am.

Time...I am.

Ceaseless to the end...I am.

---

Every gas cloud...I am.

Every sun coalescing...I am.

Every sun burning...I am.

Every star dying...I am.

Every nova exploding...I am.

---

Every muon...I am

Every quark...I am.

Every atom...I am.

Every molecule...I am.

Every physical structure...I am.

---

Every dying star,

Every plant growing, dying, eaten,

Every animal fed,

Every embryo born from that food,

Every life that has and will ever live,

I am.

---

Who am I but that which I am?

When I am bounded, I know not who I am

When I know not who I am, we are.

When I know who I am, I am.
