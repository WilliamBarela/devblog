The answer is blindingly obvious once you know "it".

You wake up every morning and see "it" all around and within.

You spend the rest of "it" trying to understand what "it" is.

Our every joy comes from "it".

When we forget that WE are "it" and that "it" is "I", alienation arises, fear arises, sorrow arises, "ME" arises.

If we could just remember that "I" am "it", then it is clear that "it" is "me".

Therefore, if I wish to experience compassion in every moment, I must in every moment exercise compassion towards "it".

If I wish to experience the wellspring of joy, "I" must enjoy "it" and "I" must be kind to "it".

In other words, live to be in the state of "I"'m loving "it".

...Hey, who said that fast food didn't produce anything good? Even in it, you will find "it".

If "I" love myself and "I" hate ANY of "it", it only means that I don't know that "I" truly am "it".

What, therefore, am "it".
