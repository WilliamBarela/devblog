The answer is blindingly obvious once you understand "it".

You wake up every morning and see "it" all around and within.

You spend the rest of "it" trying to understand what "it" is.

Our every joy comes from "it".

You know "it" by exploring and experiencing "it".

"It" can only be understood by listening to "it" with full awareness and experiencing your relationship to "it" as "it".

When we forget that WE are "it" and that "it" is "I", alienation arises, fear arises, sorrow arises, "ME" arises.

If we could just remember that "I" am "it", then it is clear that "it" is "me".

Therefore, if we wish to experience compassion in every moment, "I" must in every moment exercise compassion towards ALL of "it".

If we wish to experience the wellspring of joy, "I" must enjoy "it" and "I" must be kind to "it", because "it" is me, and "I" am "it".

In other words, live to be in the state of "I"'m loving "it".

...Hey, who said that fast food didn't produce anything good? Even in it, you will find "it".

If "I" love myself and "I" hate ANY of "it", it only means that I don't understand that "I" truly am "it".

'"What" there is', is "it". All of "it".

That means, "you" also are "it". Remember that.
